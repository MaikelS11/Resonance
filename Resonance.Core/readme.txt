Resonance - A super lightweight eventing library, with support for heavyweight scenarios!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resonance requires a database for storage. For now only SQL server is supported. To create
the database (or add the required tables to an existing database), you must execute the
SQL database script first.

To get the database script:
- It may have been added to the root of your product when installing Resonance!
- When you project is a NETCore project, this probably didn't work, so you need to download
  it manually from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwaazaar/Resonance/master/Resonance.Core/Content/ResonanceDB.sql

A sample console app (.NET Core) can be found here: https://github.com/kwaazaar/Resonance-Cli-Demo

Good luck!
