Resonance - A super lightweight eventing library, with support for heavyweight scenarios!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resonance requires a database for storage. Both MS SQL server and MySql are supported. To create
the database (or add the required tables to an existing database), you must execute the
relevant SQL database script first (there are different scripts for both DBMSs).

To get the database script, you can grab it from the packages-folder or download it from the repository:
  - MS Sql Server: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwaazaar/Resonance/master/Resonance.Core/content/ResonanceDB.MsSql.sql
  - MySql: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwaazaar/Resonance/master/Resonance.Core/content/ResonanceDB.MySql.sql

A sample console app (.NET Core) can be found here: https://github.com/kwaazaar/Resonance-Cli-Demo

Good luck!
